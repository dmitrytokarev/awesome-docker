We appreciate and recognize [all contributors](https://github.com/veggiemonk/awesome-docker/graphs/contributors).

# Contribution Guidelines

- **To add to the list:** Submit a pull request
- **To remove from the list:** Open an issue

`awesome-docker` is a hand-crafted list for high-quality information about docker and its resources.

- Each item should be limited to one link
- The link should be the name of the package or project or website
- Descriptions should be clear and concise (read it out loud to be sure)
- Descriptions should follow the link, on the same line

Please contribute links to packages/projects you have used or are familiar with. This will help ensure high-quality entries.


## Quality standard

To be on the list, it would be *nice* if entries adhere to these quality standards:

- Generally useful to the community
- Clearly stating when a entry is relating to (Linux) containers and not Docker
- Clearly "what is it" --> which category it belongs : article, docker image, dev tools, video, twitter account, ...
- Clearly stating "what is it for": mention the problem it solves. Just try your best, make it clear for the next person.
- Solves a real problem (even a small one)
- if it is a work in progress (not safe for production), mention it. (Remember the time before Docker 1.0 ? ;-) )
